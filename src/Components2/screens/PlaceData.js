        Info: "Hamida Banu Begum, who was the wife of the Mughal Emperor, Humayun, after nine years of his demise ordered the construction of this tomb. It was built with red sandstone. The unique feature about this tomb is that it is a garden tomb and was the first of its kind in India back then. Apart from the main tomb, there are four other surrounding structures, which add to the beauty of the complex. The last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar had taken refuge here during the 1857 revolts away from the British, but was finally captured. It is, thus, historically a very significant monument."

        Info: "Still enclosed by failing town surfaces and three enduring gateways, the colourful and brilliant Purani Dilli is a network of small paths populated with rickshaws, covered with 17th-century havelis, and seems to be on an accident course – representing remains of the previous while being interested in what’s to come. There’s lot to do here, and we advise you employ a rickshaw to get the best of what the Old City has to provide – visit Chandni Chowk, the Sis Ganj Gurudwara (Guru Teg Bahadur was beheaded by Aurangzeb here), the Fatehpuri Masjid, Khari Baoli (reputed to be India’s biggest liven market), make pit prevents at the Paranthe Wali Gali, and Karim’s to satisfy any the urge to eat. Head further southern to Zeenat-ul Masjid (Daryaganj), or “Cloud Mosque” and Rajghat, where Gandhi was cremated."
